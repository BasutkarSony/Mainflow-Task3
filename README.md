4. Identified the top 5 students by total scores using subqueries.
5. Calculated average scores for selected groups, such as students with Math scores above 70 and total scores within specified ranges.
6. Used subqueries to find the second-highest Math score among all students.

## How to Run

1. Use any MySQL client such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin.
2. Execute the `Task-3.sql` script file step-by-step in the given order.
3. Verify query results after each step to observe the data processing and insights.
